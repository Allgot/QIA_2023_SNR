# QIA_2023_SNR
This is a repository for sharing the code of Team SNR(Sanarae) in QIA2023 (KAIST).

**The data should not be shared, so we intentionally exclude the data from our repository.**

## Phase 1
We've made various approaches, but you can see all of them in one file: `SNR_Phase1_sort-based.ipynb`. You need appropriate packages, with `Python 3.10`.

## Phase 2
We've also tried various methods for phase 2, and we've divided them into two files: `SNR_Phase2_question-based.ipynb`, `SNR_Phase2_sort-based.ipynb`. This is because their characteristics are totally different from each other, unlike the phase 1. You need appropriate packages, with `Python 3.10`.

## Report
*The final report is under maintenance, so please come back later for that.*
